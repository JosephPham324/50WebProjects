				What is a Stand ability?
			</h3>
			<p class="faq-text">
				
A Stand (スタンド Sutando) is a visual manifestation of life energy (in other words, the manifestation of the soul of the user).<br>
A Stand is an entity psychically generated by its owner, referred to as a Stand User (スタンド使い Sutando Tsukai). It generally presents itself as a figure hovering over or near the user and possesses abilities beyond that of an ordinary human, which, depending on the Stand User, can be wielded for good or evil.

				What grants Stand ability?
			</h3>

				What are the Stand stats?
			</h3>
			<p class="faq-text">
				
<b>Destructive Power (破壊力 Hakairyoku)</b>: Measures the Stand's strength and ability to cause destruction (physical injury or collateral environmental damage) in a given period of time.<br>

<b>Speed (スピード Supīdo)</b>: Measures the Stand's agility and reflexes as well as performance speed.<br>

<b>Range (射程距離 Shatei Kyori)</b>: Measures a compromise of the Stand's range of manifestation, range of ability influence, and spatial mobility.<br>

<b>Stamina (持続力 Jizoku-ryoku)</b>: Measures the duration of time that the Stand can actively maintain its ability. Long-Range Stands capable of operating remotely from their Users like Lovers and Empress are described as having high Stamina. This also applies to Materialized Stands like Yellow Temperance and Atom Heart Father that can bind to objects for long periods of time.<br>

<b>Precision (精密動作性 Seimitsu Dōsa-sei)</b>: Measures the Stand's accuracy and range of influence/effect of their abilities to specified targets. Automatic type Stands are generally evaluated with Rank D or under with a few exceptions.<br>

<b>Development Potential (成長性 Seichō-sei)</b>: Measures the Stand's possible functions, utilization of its abilities and powers, and capacity to improve its overall capabilities. It decreases in rank as the user masters their Stand.
